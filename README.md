Analysis software development for IR AFM scan images and hyperspectral Scans 

This sofware is part of hyperspectral analysis methods used in manuscript of: "Nanoscale chemical characterization of secondary protein structure of F-Actin using mid-infrared photoinduced force microscopy (PiF-IR)".

Contributions in this code so far have been made by Sebastian Unger, Maryam Ali, René Lachmann, Rainer Heintzmann, Daniela Täuber, Meng Luo, and Mohammad Soltaninezhad

It aims at developing tools for processing spectral data from vibrational nanospectroscopy methods, and conventional FTIR (and Raman spectroscopy) for comparison.

So far experimental methods have been:

- photo-induced force microscopy (PiFM)
- FTIR
- Raman spectroscopy
- optical photothermal infrared spectroscopy (O-PTIR)


This code analyse the hyper spectral data by:
- Plotting generated images: Topography, hypersctral image, and phase image.
- Plotting the mean spectrum on PiFM intensity.
- Principal Component Analysis PCA represented by loaded components plot, scatter plot, and individual component factor plots.
