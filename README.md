Analysis software development for IR AFM scan images and hyperspectral Scans 

This sofware is part of hyperspectral analysis methods used in the manuscript of: "Nanoscale chemical characterization of secondary protein structure of F-Actin using mid-infrared photoinduced force microscopy (PiF-IR)".

Contributions in this code so far have been made by Sebastian Unger, Maryam Ali, René Lachmann, Rainer Heintzmann, Daniela Täuber, and Mohammad Soltaninezhad

This code analyzes the hyperspectral data by:
- Plotting generated images: AFM Topography, integrated PiF-IR hyperspectral image, and AFM phase image.
- Plotting the mean spectrum on PiFM intensity.
- Principal Component Analysis PCA represented by loaded components plot, scatter plot, and individual component factor plots.

Two PiF-IR hyperspectral data sets have been analysed using hyPIRana. The Raw data are available in this repository:
- single-fibrillar F-Actin
- crosslinked F-Actin
