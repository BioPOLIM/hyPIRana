MonIRana is a program for analysis of a set of spectral data provided in a tabulated textfile

This code has been developed to analyze single spectral dataset from mid-IR Photo-induced Force Microscopy (PiF-IR) 
Contributions in this code so far have been made by:
Mohammad Soltaninezhad, Sebastian Unger, Maryam Ali, and Daniela TÃ¤uber. 

monIRana can do:
- Calibration
- Calculate mean spectra of the complete data set
- Run a PCA on the data set and provide plots of results
- Clustered presentation of Amide rich & glycan rich analyzed spectra

The available raw data in this repository are for:
- Calibrated PiF-IR spectra for treated Bacillus Subtilis (classified to Amide rich & glycan rich spectra)
- Calibrated PiF-IR spectra for untreated Bacillus Subtilis (control) from the same experiment
